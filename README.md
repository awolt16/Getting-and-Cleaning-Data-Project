One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. The data used here represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. In this experiment 30 different subjects performed 6 different activities such as walking or standing. Many different measurements were taken while the subjects were performing each activity such as acceleration or time. 

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following: merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set; extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (such as walking or standing); appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (such as frequency or acceleration); and from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The explanation of the R script TidyData.txt is included in the CodeBook.md.
